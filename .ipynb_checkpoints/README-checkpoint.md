## 🚀 How to Run

Follow these steps to run the tasks on your local system:

1. Open **Anaconda Prompt** and go to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd path\to\py-task
   jupyter notebook
Open each of the notebooks:

task1_api_visualization.ipynb

task2_pdf_report.ipynb

task3_chatbot_nlp.ipynb

task4_ml_prediction.ipynb

Install required Python libraries (if not already installed):

pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn requests fpdf nltk scikit-learn
For Task 3 (NLP Chatbot), also run:

import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')
Run each notebook cell-by-cell using Shift + Enter.

Task 2 will generate a PDF (custom_sales_report.pdf) automatically.
